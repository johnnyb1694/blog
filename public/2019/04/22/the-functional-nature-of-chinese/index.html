<h1 id="seize-the-day">Seize the day!</h1>

<p>One of my all-time favourite scenes in popular cinema comes from Richard Linklater&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Boyhood&rdquo;:</p>

<p>In it, the protagonist (Mason) concedes that he is constantly &lsquo;seized&rsquo; by the moment, rather than the &lsquo;moment&rsquo; being seized by him and I often feel the same way about my life. So many things have happened to me that weren&rsquo;t pre-conceived on my part. &lsquo;Carpe diem&rsquo; is a lot more like, &lsquo;Carpe&hellip;wait, what?&rsquo; when it comes to my life.</p>

<p>Indeed, when I am asked (regularly) why I chose to learn Chinese, my answer, as cliche as it sounds, is that Chinese probably chose me and I ran with it - much the same way in which the moment seized the character Mason. There was no grand narrative or reasoning behind my choice.</p>

<h1 id="chinese-is-more-simple-than-you-think">Chinese is more simple than you think&hellip;</h1>

<p>The thing about Chinese that makes it different to other languages I&rsquo;ve tried to (had to!) learn in the past - such as French and German - is that the creators of the language had obviously paid close attention to <em>design</em> from the outset (that or they got lucky, which is also possible).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the concept of joining &lsquo;characters&rsquo; as opposed to joining items of an &lsquo;alphabet&rsquo;: this is one aspect of Chinese or Japanese which often strikes fear into the hearts of those interested in learning these languages. People are used to having a finite alphabet. By contrast, they probably don&rsquo;t like the uncertainty associated with the seemingly infinite number of Chinese characters.</p>

<p>However, this fear is misplaced.</p>
