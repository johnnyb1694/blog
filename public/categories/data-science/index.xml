      <description>A story about ‘Steve’  “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.”
 In his seminal work, “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Daniel Kahneman - referring to this short description - poses the following question: is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?</description>

      <description>Introduction In this segment we perform a brief analysis of data on student-teacher ratios across countries worldwide - the data is from the tidytuesday segment on github.
Limited by time constraints and actuarial exams, this is a relatively short post; however, it showcases some of the functional tools you can use in purrr to make your code more powerful.

      <description>Preamble on ‘Project Gutenberg’ It’s been a little while since I’ve practiced text mining so I thought I would analyse some textual data provided by Project Gutenberg. In case you were not aware, Project Gutenberg consists of various articles and literary contributions (amongst other things) written, in the main, by authors whose works are now in the US public domain and largely exempt from any copyright infringement. For the UK, the law is that copyright applies to somebody else’s work until 70 years after their date of death.</description>

      <description>Introduction The data for this post comes from the Vera institute. It comes as a timely reminder of the racial injustice that still exists in the United States prison system. If anyone is looking to learn more about this topic, then I recommend watching the documentary ‘13th’ - the name refers to the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery throughout the United States and ended involuntary servitude except as a punishment for a crime.</description>
