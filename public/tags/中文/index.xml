      <description>Diem Carpe? One of my all-time favourite scenes in popular cinema comes from Richard Linklater&amp;rsquo;s film &amp;ldquo;Boyhood&amp;rdquo;. In it, the protagonist (Mason) concedes that he is constantly &amp;lsquo;seized&amp;rsquo; by the moment, rather than the &amp;lsquo;moment&amp;rsquo; being seized by him and I often feel the same way about my life. So many things have happened to me that weren&amp;rsquo;t pre-conceived on my part.
Indeed, when I am asked (regularly) why I chose to learn Chinese of all languages, my answer, as cliche as it sounds, is that Chinese probably chose me and I ran with it - much the same way in which the moment seized the character Mason.</description>
