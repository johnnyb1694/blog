      <description>A story about ‘Steve’  “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.”

      <description>My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in the city of London.
I started this blog after coming across David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s excellent presentation at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he explained the value of making one&amp;rsquo;s work public. Indeed, recognition and constructive criticism of one&amp;rsquo;s work are crucial.
Aside from data science, I am also passionate about learning Chinese! I will release a short series of posts in the future detailing my approach to learning languages in the future.</description>
