      <description>The Dreyfus affair  “I swear that I am innocent. I remain worthy of serving in the Army. Long live France! Long live the Army!”
 These were the famous words uttered by Alfred Dreyfus as he was convicted by fellow French officials in a secret court martial back in 1895, following allegations of espionage and treason against the French state. The incident - commonly referred to as the ‘Dreyfus affair’ - went down as one of the most controversial and polarising political dramas in all of French history.</description>

      <description>You’ve been feeling under the weather for more than a couple of days and things don’t seem to be improving. So, you pluck up the courage to call your local doctor. He tells you that it’s probably just an innocuous virus but he decides to run a series of remote tests on you regardless, ‘just to be safe’.
The next day you receive your results: your doctor informs you that you have tested positive for a very serious disease that only affects approximately 5% of the global population.</description>

      <description>A story about ‘Steve’  “Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little interest in people or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail.”
 In his seminal work, “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Daniel Kahneman - referring to this short description - poses the following question: is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?</description>

      <description>My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in the city of London.
I started this blog after coming across David Robinson&amp;rsquo;s excellent presentation at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he explained the value of making one&amp;rsquo;s work public. Indeed, recognition and constructive criticism of one&amp;rsquo;s work are crucial.
Aside from data science, I am also passionate about learning Chinese! I will release a short series of posts in the future detailing my approach to learning languages in the future.</description>
