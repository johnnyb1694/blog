My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in the city of London.

I started this blog after coming across David Robinson's [excellent presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he explained the value of making one's work public. Indeed, recognition and constructive criticism of one's work are crucial.

Aside from data science, I am also passionate about learning Chinese! I will release a short series of posts in the future detailing my approach to learning languages in the future.
