I started this blog after being inspired by David Robinson's [excellent presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he discussed the importance of sharing one's own work.

I believe in using data in a responsible manner to provide others with insights. As such, everything in this blog is presented at a high level. To those of you who are interested in reading the underlying code can do so by referring to my [GitHub](https://github.com/johnnyb1694).

I hope you enjoy my posts!
