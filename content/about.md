My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in London.

I started this blog after being inspired by David Robinson's [excellent presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he discussed the importance of sharing one's own work.

The object of the blog is statistical analysis but anyone is welcome to read. Topics are presented at a high level and those who are interested in reading the underlying code can do so by referring to my [GitHub](https://github.com/johnnyb1694).

I hope you enjoy my posts!
