My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in London - for those unaware of what this job entails, I refer you to this [gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTsMRsR8ABc&t=22s). 

I started this blog after coming across David Robinson's [excellent presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he explained the - perhaps underestimated - value of making your work public. Indeed, the presentation made me realise that you lose out by not sharing your work with others: recognition and constructive criticism of your work are both crucial.

Aside from data analysis, I am also passionate about learning Chinese! If you are curious about learning languages I plan to release a short series in the future detailing my personal approach to this. Stay tuned!
