My name is Johnny Breen and I currently work as an actuarial consultant in London.

I started this blog after being inspired by David Robinson's [excellent presentation](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-public-work) at the 2019 R Studio Conference, where he discussed the importance of sharing one's own work.

Though the object of this blog is statistical analysis, the real purpose of the blog is to share insights on topics I am interested in with just about anyone who may be interested in - but not necessarily knowledgeable about - statistics. To this end, anyone should be able to follow along (and do [let me know](johnnyb1694@gmail.com) if I have not explained something correctly).

Remember, statistics is a skill and anybody can learn it!
