# Diem Carpe?

One of my all-time favourite scenes in popular cinema comes from Richard Linklater's film "Boyhood". In it, the protagonist (Mason) concedes that he is constantly 'seized' by the moment, rather than the 'moment' being seized by him and I often feel the same way about my life. So many things have happened to me that weren't pre-conceived on my part. 

Indeed, when I am asked (regularly) why I chose to learn Chinese of all languages, my answer, as cliche as it sounds, is that Chinese probably chose me and I ran with it - much the same way in which the moment seized the character Mason. There was no grand narrative or reasoning behind my choice. It was simply some kind of fate which brought me here.

I will be sharing more posts very soon on how I managed to learn Chinese to a reasonable standard and what advice I may have for beginners just starting out - stay tuned!
